Hi, I am a looking for python developer who can convert delimiter file with below requirements

Please find below requirement.

Please consider below things while working:
1. We are trying to process large amount of ml files - around 1,000,000 xml files
2. we are trying to process as quick as possible trying python
3. we need all validation complete with in process itself. - try to use one loop inside or other performance technoques like buffers.

Below are requiremets:

1. We want to process all input variables in [config.txt] and get log file[log.txt] as output.


We need to handle below things in code
1.  Field Separator
sample data1: ["address 1, 'address 2', address 3"] 
sampel data2 : ['address', "address"]  - if dat ahaving ' and " we need to handle.
2. Removing control characters [input file will be ASCII file encoding] so remove control characters https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars/c0.html except '\t' and '\n' [tab and new line]
3. Add multiple threading process -- if possible?
4. add or append:  


Sample input config.txt file below:

File name: config.txt 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
inputfilepath: 'input.xml'
expected delimiter: comma
header(yes/no): 1
outputfilepath: 'output.txt'
Wrap values in double quotes : yes/no
encoding type: utf-8
Removing non printable/Control characters: yes
Add multiple threading : 
error file requied: [yes/no]
error file path: 'error.txt'
error log file requied : [yes/no]
error log path : 'errorlog.txt'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expected a log file with below details. which will give all details about processing a file.

file name: log.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------------
inputfilepath: 'input.xml'
expected delimiter: comma
header(yes/no): 1
outputfilepath: 'output.txt'
Wrap values in double quotes : yes/no
encoding type: utf-8
Removing non printable/Control characters: yes
Add multiple threading : 
error file requied: [yes/no]
error file path: 'error.txt'
error log file requied : [yes/no]
error log path : 'errorlog.txt'
error file requied: 1
error file path: 'error.txt'
error log file requied : 1
error log path : 'errorlog.txt'
Removing non printable/Control characters: yes
Add multiple threading : 2 threads
Input file size: 34MB
Output file size: 30MB
File processing start time: time here
File processing end time:  time here
Total time taken to process file: 3seconds
encoding : utf-8
Status: Process completed/failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you do this?
